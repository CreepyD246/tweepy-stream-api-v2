# tweepy-stream-api-v2
This is the basic setup for a Tweepy stream using Twitter's v2 API.
It's important to watch the tutorial video that was made for this repository, as I discuss important details.
This also isn't the best way to create streams, but I discuss this in a future tutorial (This is just a beginner tutorial).
It's also assumed that you already have Tweepy set up.
